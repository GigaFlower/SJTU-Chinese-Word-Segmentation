Through this project, I have learned a lot, encompassing my programming ability, computational thinking as well as teamwork. What impressed me most is that before one project starts, I should have a clear mind of the whole graph, and namely, I should have long-term thoughts. A well-designed structure will do a lot of help to later changes. As a result, a good program must have a good start, which means that a well-designed structure is a must. In this case, I need to gain more experience to learn to design the structure as good as possible.  ¡ª¡ªby HgS_1217_
